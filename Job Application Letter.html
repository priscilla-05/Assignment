    <p>Daily Mail Manager</p>
    <p>450 W 33rd Street, New York, NY 10001</p>
    <p>New York</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>With Regards,</p>
     <br><br>
     <p>Herewith I send an application letter and curriculum vitae in response to your advertisement in the Daily Times, Sunday, 15 May 2011</p>
     <p>I have had an experience over the past five years as marketing manager of cosmetics and hair care products at Surya Ayu Cosmetic, Washington. In that position I'm responsible for sales in the Washington area, San Antonio, Deanver, Dallas.</p>
     <p>I realize that your resume or curriculum vitae that I submit this can not explain my qualifications in depth. Therefore, I really hope there is a chance interview, which I can explain how the potential in me and my ministry will give a tremendous asset for PT's Daily Mail.</p>
     <br><br>
     <p>Sincerely,</p>
     <br><br>
     <p>White Sampurna</p>
